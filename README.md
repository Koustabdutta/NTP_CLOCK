# ‚è∞ Raspberry Pi Pico W NTP Clock with I2C LCD (PCF8574)

This project displays real-time NTP-synced clock data on a 16x2 LCD using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and PCF8574 I2C backpack. The clock automatically connects to Wi-Fi, fetches accurate time from an NTP server, and displays it in HH:MM:SS format.

## üß† Software Requirements

- [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/)
- MicroPython firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Files to upload:
  - `main.py`
  - `lcd_api.py`
  - `i2c_lcd.py`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Flash MicroPython to your Pico W.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open `main.py` in Thonny.
4. Replace `your_SSID` and `your_PASSWORD` with your Wi-Fi credentials.
5. Upload all three files to the Pico W.
6. Run the code and view the time on the LCD!

## üåê Time Zone Configuration

To adjust for your time zone:
```python
TIME_OFFSET = 5.5 * 3600  # For IST (UTC+5:30)
